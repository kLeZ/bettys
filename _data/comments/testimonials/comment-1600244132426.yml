  I highly recommend Roberta Scarpetti as a highly caring, informative, flexible, safe SEND
  teacher. I have had the pleasure of working with Roberta for the past year. She is driven,
  organianised teacher who develops inspiring relationship with her student. My daughter with
  special needs has developed greatly under her capacity as a lead teacher within our local
  playgroup in Camden.<br/>
  Roberta has always been so accommodating to my daughter’s sensory issues in how she
  conducts herself in front of her. She has always been driven to develop her skills as a SEND
  carer/ Teacher and always keeping us informed on my daughter’s development as seen in her
  classes. She continued to demonstrate this drive through her time working with my daughter.<br/>
  Roberta has a wonderful rapport with people of all ages, especially children. Her ability to
  connect with my daughter who has SEND and her talent at teaching simple concepts, as well
  as more advanced topics, are both truly superior. She has excellent written and verbal
  communication skills with both carers (parents, nanny, granny) and students.<br/>
  Roberta always had a positive attitude. I recommend Roberta to you without reservation to
  work with SEND children. If you have any further questions regarding her dealings with us,
  please do not hesitate to contact me.
