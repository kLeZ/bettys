message: "I highly recommend Roberta Scarpetti as a highly caring, informative, flexible, safe SEND\r\nteacher. I have had the pleasure of working with Roberta for the past year. She is driven,\r\norganianised teacher who develops inspiring relationship with her student. My daughter with\r\nspecial needs has developed greatly under her capacity as a lead teacher within our local\r\nplaygroup in Camden.\r\nRoberta has always been so accommodating to my daughter’s sensory issues in how she\r\nconducts herself in front of her. She has always been driven to develop her skills as a SEND\r\ncarer/ Teacher and always keeping us informed on my daughter’s development as seen in her\r\nclasses. She continued to demonstrate this drive through her time working with my daughter.\r\nRoberta has a wonderful rapport with people of all ages, especially children. Her ability to\r\nconnect with my daughter who has SEND and her talent at teaching simple concepts, as well\r\nas more advanced topics, are both truly superior. She has excellent written and verbal\r\ncommunication skills with both carers (parents, nanny, granny) and students.\r\nRoberta always had a positive attitude. I recommend Roberta to you without reservation to\r\nwork with SEND children. If you have any further questions regarding her dealings with us,\r\nplease do not hesitate to contact me."
