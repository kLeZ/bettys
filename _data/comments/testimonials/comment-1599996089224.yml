  I can't thank Roberta enough for the care that she has provided to my
  daughter.

  She has been able to see past surface level behaviour to understand
  the underlying emotional issues that my daughter faces every day, and as such,
  has really helped her to start managing her emotions appropriately.

  Her kind and generous nature really shines through in every interaction, she is able to
  relate to my daughter in a way that other professionals cannot, and is
  committed to making my daughter feel important and special.

  I would certainly recommend Roberta to anyone seeking childcare and especially for children who
  are facing additional challenges in their lives.
