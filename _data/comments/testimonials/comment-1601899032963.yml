message: "Roberta participated in our son Ibrahim’s Son-Rise program for four years (July 14 to July 18). Son-Rise is a home-based program for children with autism. Roberta spent 1:1 time with Ibrahim in his playroom in which she used different play activities to aid Ibrahim’s social development. \r\n\r\nRoberta has demonstrated her willingness and enthusiasm when she interacted with Ibrahim. She also demonstrated her ability to work as a team where we shared ideas and feedback in order to find the best possible play activities to increase Ibrahim’s development. Very positive attitude with lots of energy, excitement and enthusiasm.   \r\n\r\nOver the years, she took Ibrahim out to parks, shops, trains rides, museums, and coffee shops so that Ibrahim can learn about lifestyle skills.\r\n\r\nWe were delighted to have Roberta as part of Ibrahim’s Son Rise program, and really appreciated her contribution and commitment."
