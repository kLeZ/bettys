      Is your child timid? Is he shy to speak up? Is he reticent to join conversations or group activities? I believe that confidence is the bedrock and gateway to <i>all</i> skills. Once a child believes in himself he can achieve anything, but more importantly, he won’t be scared of obstacles or rejection.

  - title: Behaviour Management

      Similar to adults, children feel overwhelmed and overstimulated at times. Sadly, this is an aspect of modern life. If your child is experiencing these feelings, it's important to guide and give her the tools to handle and cope with any situation that will come her way. Through my work, I believe that children can learn to identify and listen to their own feelings and model good behaviour.

      We express our thoughts and desires through verbal and non-verbal communication--these are essential skills in any aspect of life. If babies and young children are taught and encouraged to communicate effectively, their confidence and creativity will flow naturally, allowing them to become successful individuals.
